├── Student Information
│   ├── Student ID
│   ├── Full Name
│   ├── Program/Department
│   └── Photo Reference
├── Pass Details
│   ├── Issue Date
│   ├── Expiry Date
│   ├── Access Level
│   └── Pass Status
├── Security Features

5. **Access Level Check**: Confirms appropriate access permissions
6. **Logging**: Records access attempt with timestamp and location

### QR Code Scanner Operation

#### Mobile App Scanning
1. **Open Scanner**: Launch the security app and select "Scan Pass"
2. **Position Device**: Hold device 6-12 inches from QR code
3. **Steady Scanning**: Keep device stable for 2-3 seconds
4. **Read Results**: Review verification outcome
5. **Take Action**: Grant or deny access based on results

#### Fixed Scanner Operation
1. **Wake Screen**: Touch screen or wave hand near sensor
2. **Position Pass**: Hold pass flat against scanner window
3. **Wait for Beep**: Listen for confirmation tone
4. **Check Display**: Review verification results
5. **Manual Override**: Use security code if needed

### Verification Results

## Frequently Asked Questions

### Technical Questions

**Q: What do I do if the QR scanner won't read a pass?**
A: First, ensure the pass is positioned correctly and the scanner lens is clean. Try adjusting lighting or asking the student to hold the pass steady. If still failing, use manual verification and report scanner issue to IT.

**Q: How do I know if the system is offline?**
A: Check the connectivity indicator in the top-right corner of your screen. If red or showing "Offline," switch to manual procedures and report the issue immediately.

**Q: What information should I collect for incident reports?**
A: Record date/time, location, people involved, description of incident, actions taken, and any relevant system information or error messages.

### Procedural Questions

**Q: Can I override the system to grant access?**
A: Manual overrides should only be used in emergencies or with supervisor approval. Always document the reason and follow up with proper procedures.

**Q: What do I do with expired passes?**
A: Do not grant access with expired passes. Direct the student to the administrative office to renew their pass. Document the attempt.

**Q: How do I handle visitors without passes?**
A: Follow your institution's visitor policy. Typically, visitors need temporary passes from administration or must be escorted by authorized personnel.

### System Questions

**Q: How often is the pass database updated?**
A: The database updates in real-time for pass status changes. However, during network issues, updates may be delayed.

**Q: Can students share their passes?**
A: No, passes are non-transferable and for individual use only. Sharing passes is a policy violation that should be reported.

**Q: What's the difference between suspended and expired passes?**
A: Expired passes have reached their end date, while suspended passes are temporarily disabled due to administrative action.
