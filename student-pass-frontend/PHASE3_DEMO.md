## ðŸš¦ Getting Started

### Prerequisites
```bash
# Required dependencies are already installed
npm install
```

### Run Development Server
```bash
npm run dev
```

### Demo Users
The system includes mock users for testing:
- **Student**: john.doe@university.edu
- **Admin**: admin@university.edu  
- **Security**: security@university.edu

### Navigation Routes
- **Student**: `/student/dashboard`, `/student/applications`, `/student/passes`
