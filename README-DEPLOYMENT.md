## 🔄 Deployment Strategies

### 1. Blue-Green Deployment (Recommended for Production)

```bash
./scripts/deploy.sh production blue-green
```

- **Zero downtime** deployments
- **Instant rollback** capability
- **Full environment validation** before traffic switch
- **Resource intensive** (requires 2x capacity during deployment)

### 2. Canary Deployment

```bash
./scripts/deploy.sh production canary
```

- **Gradual rollout** with traffic splitting
- **Risk mitigation** through staged deployment
- **Automated rollback** on error rate thresholds
- **Monitoring-driven** deployment decisions

### 3. Rolling Update

```bash
./scripts/deploy.sh production rolling
```

- **Resource efficient** deployment
- **Continuous availability** during updates
- **Built-in Kubernetes** strategy
- **Longer deployment** time

## 🏭 CI/CD Pipeline

### Continuous Integration (CI)

Triggered on every push and pull request:

1. **Code Quality:**
   - Linting (ESLint, Prettier)
   - Unit tests with coverage
   - Integration tests
   - Type checking

2. **Security:**
   - Dependency vulnerability scanning
   - SAST (Static Application Security Testing)
   - Docker image security scanning
   - License compliance checks

3. **Build & Package:**
   - Multi-stage Docker builds
   - Image optimization and caching
   - Registry push with semantic versioning

### Continuous Deployment (CD)

#### Staging Pipeline
- **Automatic deployment** on develop branch
- **Smoke tests** and integration validation
- **Performance benchmarking**
- **Security scanning** in running environment

#### Production Pipeline
- **Manual approval** gate for production
- **Blue-green deployment** by default
- **Automated health checks** and validation
- **Rollback on failure** detection
- **Notification** to team channels

## 💾 Backup and Disaster Recovery

### Automated Backups

```bash
# Full backup (daily)
./scripts/backup.sh production full

# Incremental backup (hourly)
./scripts/backup.sh production incremental

# Database-only backup
./scripts/backup.sh production database-only
```

### Backup Strategy

- **Daily full backups** with 30-day retention
- **Hourly incremental backups** for minimal data loss
- **Cross-region replication** for disaster recovery
- **Automated backup verification** and integrity checks

### Recovery Procedures

1. **Point-in-time recovery** for database
2. **Application state restoration** from backups
3. **Infrastructure recreation** from Terraform
4. **Automated failover** to secondary region

## 🧪 Testing Strategy

### Performance Testing

```bash
# Load testing with k6
k6 run --out json=results.json scripts/load-test.js

# Stress testing
k6 run --vus 1000 --duration 10m scripts/load-test.js
```

### Testing Levels

1. **Unit Tests:** Component-level testing with Jest
2. **Integration Tests:** API and database integration
3. **End-to-End Tests:** Full user journey testing
4. **Performance Tests:** Load and stress testing
5. **Security Tests:** Vulnerability and penetration testing

## 🔄 Rollback Procedures

### Automatic Rollback

- **Health check failures** trigger automatic rollback
- **Error rate thresholds** initiate rollback procedures
- **Performance degradation** detection and rollback

### Manual Rollback

```bash
# Rollback to previous version
./scripts/rollback.sh production

# Rollback to specific revision
./scripts/rollback.sh production 3
```

## 📈 Scaling and Performance

### Horizontal Pod Autoscaling

```yaml
apiVersion: autoscaling/v2
kind: HorizontalPodAutoscaler
metadata:
  name: backend-hpa
spec:
  scaleTargetRef:
    apiVersion: apps/v1
    kind: Deployment
    name: backend-deployment
  minReplicas: 3
  maxReplicas: 50
  metrics:
  - type: Resource
    resource:
      name: cpu
      target:
        type: Utilization
        averageUtilization: 70
  - type: Resource
    resource:
      name: memory
      target:
        type: Utilization
        averageUtilization: 80
```

### Cluster Autoscaling

- **Node group scaling** based on pod requirements
- **Spot instance integration** for cost optimization
- **Multi-AZ deployment** for high availability
- **Resource request optimization** for efficient scheduling

## 🚨 Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **Pod Startup Failures:**
   ```bash
   kubectl logs -f deployment/backend-deployment -n production
   kubectl describe pod <pod-name> -n production
   ```

2. **Database Connection Issues:**
   ```bash
   kubectl exec -it deployment/backend-deployment -n production -- npm run db:test
   ```

3. **Network Connectivity:**
   ```bash
   kubectl exec -it deployment/backend-deployment -n production -- nslookup postgres-service
   ```
